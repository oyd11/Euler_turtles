Turtles as complex roots of unity

A "Turtle", Ie, a "classical LOGO" turtle - if given additional "intrinsic" bahaviour - can become a Complex-Root-Of-Unity. Or any-other complex number. This behaviour can be used to get insights, or weird hacks done.

Commiting my 10 y/o MSW-logo source, of the Discrete-Fourier-Transform (DFT) implemented in Turtle-Geometry. Initial historic commit.
Idea by my KonCon.nl teacher, Peter Pabon.

TODO: Write contemporary interactive "web" version(s), explaination, maybe exercises.
